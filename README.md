# BorgEmployerWebsite

Created between November 2011 and March 2012 for a Co-op.
The period between November and January 2012, I had worked inside the office full time.
Starting in January, I transitioned to working outside the office, due to the internship
period having ended. The company and myself both wished to continue the work on the website,
so I continued development on an hourly basis.

This website was designed to allow employers to register themselves and their own employees.
The website would notify employers of employment dates and birth dates. The other main function
is that employers could buy "points" through Paypal (connected to the business's account) so
that employees could spend these points to get physical items as a reward.

The philosophy behind this system is that employer/employee relations and employee morale
are incredibly important aspects of any functional business. This system allows the
employers and employees connect on an easier level and make employees feel respected and 
appreciated.
